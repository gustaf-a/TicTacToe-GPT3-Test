Asked ChatGPT:
"I have a tic tac toe game written with C# for WPF. I want to be able to increase the grid and window size dynamically. Can you write the XAML for this game? I want it to be with nice colors and to have a frame around the playing board. I want the player to be able to adjust the size of the board and I want a score board showing victories for the two different players. Thank you"

Code code not working fully. 
"The current InitializeBoard method can't find spBoard. Can you update this method to fix this?"

"There's a bug here: 
grid.Children.Add(spBoard); 

The grid isn't defined in the context. How should I fix this?"

Fixed manually:
- Change classname in xaml
- Add name for main Grid
- Add button naming when creating buttons
